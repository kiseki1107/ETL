# ETL
This is primarily an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) project for data cleaning and data manipulation practices. The scope of this project is to obtain at least two different datasets (BoardGameGeek and KickStarter datasets from Kaggle in this case) to be cleaned up and organized into a single master table or dataFrame for possible future analyses. There is an attached word documentation to explain the process.
